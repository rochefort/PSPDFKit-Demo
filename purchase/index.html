          <h2>Licence</h2>
          <p>
            One license is eligible for a single app bundle ID and Enterprise App Store. Additional licenses must be purchased for additional apps/deployments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications which expose PSPDFKit's functionality via a login-system that is bound to a backend service where customers can pay for access require a custom license agreement. (See our license for details)
          </p>
          <p class="gray">
            If you're unsure about your license requirements or have a different use case, contact us with your project requirements.

          <p class="gray">

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="halfwidth">

          <p><b>Q: What is an explicit application ID?</b></p>
          <p>A: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1713/_index.html">An explicit application ID is a string identifier unique to each iOS app.</a> Each PSPDFKit license is tied to such an identifier.</p>

          <p><b>Q: Do you offer discounts for educational and non-profit organizations?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes, we love to support projects in the educational and non-profit space! <a href="mailto:sales@pspdfkit.com?subject=PSPDFKit%20Non-Profit">Contact us with your project requirements with your .edu or non-profit organization email.</a></p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Do you provide support?</b></p>
          <p>A: Of course! We can help you with all aspects on integrating PSPDFKit and we're open about feedback/bugs/feature requests to further improve our framework. <b>Please always contact us with your PET* purchase number so we can help you more efficiently.</b> This is especially important for Enterprise customers with <b>Priority Support</b>, those emails will be on top of the queue and we'll extend our answers with example code when needed. We sometimes also implement smaller features on the fly for Enterprise customers. You can also contact support if you're still evaluating, just include that in your email.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Do you require some form of revenue sharing?</b></p>
          <p>A: Usually the license is a one-time payment and includes support for 6 or 12 months, depending on the chosen package. After that you will get the opportunity to extend your support and update period. Certain products like having one public App Store app with a paid backend service might require a custom contract with revenue sharing. Please <a href="mailto:sales@pspdfkit.com">contact us</a> with details about your product.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Do you have a user-limit per license?</b></p>
          <p>A: No, our license is purely limited to the application ID and Enterprise install. There's no user user limitation.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Does your SDK with the iPhone/iPod Touch?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes, PSPDFKit has several special improvements so you can efficiently work with documents even on the smaller screen of an iPhone or iPod Touch.</p>

          <p><b>Q: What features are enabled in PSPDFKit Viewer?</b></p>
          <p>A: PSPDFKit Viewer is our entry-level product and perfect for magazine-like applications that don't require any of the more advanced features like <a href='/documentation/#encryption'>strong encryption</a>, annotation editing, text selection, index-search or PDF Forms. Viewer has all basic features like PDF search, multimedia annotation support (videos, audio, web pages, including custom UIViews) and all page transitions like per-page scrolling, continuous scroll or page curl. Viewer includes 6 months of updates.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Can we upgrade later on?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes, you can update to more feature-rich options with paying the price difference and a small update-fee. Keep in mind that this doesn't extend your one-year-updates cycle. (unless you're upgrading from Viewer, where 6 months of updates will be added). Contact us with your PET* purchase number for details.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Will we get the complete source code, or are there any binary only parts?</b></p>
          <p>A: With purchasing PSPDFKit Complete you will get all source code to build PSPDFKit on your own. Enterprise customers will get an additional test case suite as soon as v3 is released. The PSPDFKit source code is about 100.000 LOC and well-documented. Almost everything is developed in-house with the exception of some minor <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/acknowledgements.html">3rd-party code additions</a> (less than 5% of our product). Please be aware that we strongly discourage developers from actually changing any of the source, since the PSPDFKit internals are under constant development and you could lock yourself out of future updates. However, being able to look at the source code is extremely valuable if you're planning a deeper integration with your application.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="halfwidth">
  
          <p><b>Q: We require source code and need 3 licenses. Do we need to purchase PSPDFKit Complete three times?</b></p>
          <p>A: No. You only need one source code license for your company. For other products, you can use the binary license and your developers can still use the source version to look up specific implementation details. (Unless you require PDF Forms)</a></p>

          <p><b>Q: Can I use PSPDFKit with Enterprise apps?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes. The same explicit app ID restrictions apply. If you're using PSPDFKit in the enterprise and need multiple licenses, you should <a href="mailto:sales@pspdfkit.com">contact us with your requirements.</a></p>
          
          <p><b>Q: We sell our solution to different companies via the Enterprise App Store, do we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes. Even if you use the same application ID, if you distribute the app in multiple Enterprise App Stores and/or apply different branding, you need to purchase one license per branded application. We're flexible with such use cases, it's best to contact us for a custom agreement.</a></p>
          
          <p><b>Q: Our company policy forbids us from being listed as a customer.</b></p>
          <p>A: The license terms for PSPDFKit Enterprise are negotiable. <a href="mailto:sales@pspdfkit.com">Contact us for details.</a></p>
          
          <p><b>Q: We're offering a lite version and/or different versions for iPad and iPhone. Will we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
          <p>A: We have exceptions for certain use cases. Having a lite/full version is one of them - you're fine with one license. The same goes for the same application with two different versions for iPhone and iPad.</a></p>

          <p><b>Q: Will we need a separate license for beta versions / internal client demos?</b></p>
          <p>A: No. You can use the license you're already having to distribute beta versions, even if the beta uses a different bundle ID. Client demos are also fine, as long as they're really just a demo and not the finished product.</a></p> 
            
          <p><b>Q: Can you clarify on "Binary distribution is allowed within your app as long as it's statically linked in one binary"?</b></p>
          <p>A: This is just to ensure that you're not simply giving away the framework for free to download. If you integrate it into your app, Xcode will automatically statically link that to your final app binary.</p>  
          
          <p><b>Q: What's the Appcelerator Titanium Module?</b></p>
          <p>A: We offer a native to JavaScript bridge that works with Appcelerator Titanium. Appcelerator is a technology that allows rapid application development for companies that are more experienced with JavaScript than ObjectiveC.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: What's all supported in the Appcelerator Titanium bridge?</b></p>
          <p>A: PSPDFKit exposes only a subset of the features in the Titanium port. Enough to make a great app, probably not enough if your app requires heavy customization. However, you also get the Titanium Plugin Source Code with PSPDFKit Complete or Enterprise, so you can customize and extend the plugin bridge. Enterprise customers can also request smaller additions for free.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: We are using Xamarin/MonoTouch. Are you supporting this?</b></p>
          <p>A: Yes. The <a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/XamarinBindings">MonoTouch Bindings</a> are community generated. We help where we can, but there might be delays between the time a new PSPDFKit version is released and the time the binding is updated.</p>
          
          <p><b>Q: We are using RubyMotion.</b></p>
          <p>A: While there are no "rubified" bindings, you can simply use the existing API with RubyMotion. See this <a href="http://tom.meinlschmidt.org/2013/02/16/pspdfkit-in-rubymotion/">blog post</a> for a tutorial.</p>
