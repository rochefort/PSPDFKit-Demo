                      PSPDFKit powers the Value Accounts Holdings 2013 App - the premier reference on financial reporting in Australia. PwC used several advanced features of PSPDFKit to deeply integrate it into their app and make it more interactive. They used the delegate hooks to get notified whenever the user selects certain text and offer customize options in the popup menu to look up references. This saved them a lot of time compared to manually linking about 100 publications. They're using the annotation features to allow users to take notes, add text or scribble on the pages.

                      PSPDFKit it is without a doubt the easiest iOS PDF framework to use on the market. It is solid and provides a wealth of features that are world class, and some of which aren't even offered by competitors. In addition, the example projects (particularly PSPDFCatalog) are a fantastic way to get started and it is something on which I rely to develop my app.

                      My users and stakeholders have been blown away by what I have produced with PSPDFKit, and my company approved the purchase of a license without a second thought - it was simply a no-brainer.
